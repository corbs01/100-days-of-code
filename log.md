# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 24, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Working through Python for Everybody in FreeCodeCamp. Many focusing on While loops.

**Thoughts:** Struggle to understand fully how looping and iterations work. Once I get the hang of this it should make coding far easier.

### Day 2: July 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continue to Work through Python for Everybody in FreeCodeCamp. Today I watch a couple of video's on how to read files and loop through them. I also continued my course in Stackskill - Python Programming, CS, Algorithms and Data Structures. Currently doing linked lists, including stacked and queued. Mainly focused on revisting the code to set up a link list and how each one is written differently.

**Thoughts:** Slowly getting the hang of the connection. One thing I could not quite interpret is the self.tail.next = x component. Apart from that it all makes sense.

### Day 3: July 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continued course on binary trees in Stackskills. This looked at the rules of a binary tree, understanding decision tree, also looked at in-order, pre-order and post-order traversal. From this I went through the code in Python and commented the process.

**Thoughts:** After revising the code multiple times I was starting to understand the process and how it all links together. I also started using comments for each line to break it down into smaller bits.

### Day 4: July 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning about Binary trees in Stackskill course. This included the following:
* Deleting leaf nodes from a binary tree
* Deleting nodes with one child
* Started looking at deleting nodes with 2 children

**Thoughts:** Much the same as day 3. Code was a bit more complex than yesterday so needed to run through it a few times to ensure that it started making sense.

### Day 5: July 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Continued course on Python Programming, CS, Algorithms and Data Structures.
Looked at the flow in more details for deleting a node with 2 children. In process of starting a job schedular project in the same course.


**Thoughts:** Got a touched lost when revisiting code for completing a in-order traversal. Will re-look at the video and explore further.

### Day 6: July 29, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Revised the code for a binary search tree. This looked at adding a node to the tree and putting this in order using an in-order traversal. The course has not provided a code solution for pre and post order traversal so have started working on that and will hope to have an answer over the next couple of days


**Thoughts:** I decided I would re-write the code so I had a better grasp of what I was learning first hand. Once written it made sense but have to look at solution first. Hopefully over the next 10-15 days I will write this off memory and from general knowledge.
