# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 24, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Working through Python for Everybody in FreeCodeCamp. Many focusing on While loops.

**Thoughts:** Struggle to understand fully how looping and iterations work. Once I get the hang of this it should make coding far easier.

### Day 2: July 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continue to Work through Python for Everybody in FreeCodeCamp. Today I watch a couple of video's on how to read files and loop through them. I also continued my course in Stackskill - Python Programming, CS, Algorithms and Data Structures. Currently doing linked lists, including stacked and queued. Mainly focused on revisting the code to set up a link list and how each one is written differently.

**Thoughts:** Slowly getting the hang of the connection. One thing I could not quite interpret is the self.tail.next = x component. Apart from that it all makes sense.

### Day 3: July 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continued course on binary trees in Stackskills. This looked at the rules of a binary tree, understanding decision tree, also looked at in-order, pre-order and post-order traversal. From this I went through the code in Python and commented the process.

**Thoughts:** After revising the code multiple times I was starting to understand the process and how it all links together. I also started using comments for each line to break it down into smaller bits.

### Day 4: July 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning about Binary trees in Stackskill course. This included the following:
* Deleting leaf nodes from a binary tree
* Deleting nodes with one child
* Started looking at deleting nodes with 2 children

**Thoughts:** Much the same as day 3. Code was a bit more complex than yesterday so needed to run through it a few times to ensure that it started making sense.

### Day 5: July 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Continued course on Python Programming, CS, Algorithms and Data Structures.
Looked at the flow in more details for deleting a node with 2 children. In process of starting a job schedular project in the same course.


**Thoughts:** Got a touched lost when revisiting code for completing a in-order traversal. Will re-look at the video and explore further.

### Day 6: July 29, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Revised the code for a binary search tree. This looked at adding a node to the tree and putting this in order using an in-order traversal. The course has not provided a code solution for pre and post order traversal so have started working on that and will hope to have an answer over the next couple of days


**Thoughts:** I decided I would re-write the code so I had a better grasp of what I was learning first hand. Once written it made sense but have to look at solution first. Hopefully over the next 10-15 days I will write this off memory and from general knowledge.

### Day 7: July 30, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Finally got the code correct for pre-order traversal. About 70% confident of process. Started post-order traversal, still having a few issues with it at this stage.

**Thoughts:** Now that I have watched a fair amount of coding on video, I wanted to start practising it and understanding in more detail what was happening in the process. A slow start but good to iterate through it mentally.

### Day 8: July 31, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Solved the code for post-order traversal in python using the recursive method. Felt great as this was code that wasnâ€™t copied from course. Also rewrote code for finding a value in BST. Tomorrow I will look at deleting nodes


**Thoughts:** Made more in-roads today on understanding the code and utilising it to create a function. Felt extremely great doing this as it was the first time that code was not replicated to produce an outcome.

### Day 9 & 10: August 1 & 2, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Finished off looking at the code for finding a value in BST. Also went through all the steps for deleting a node. Next I will take a look at the project and the work-through for it.


**Thoughts:** The code is making far more sense now everytime I slowly work through it. By checking the process when there is an error has really helped me understand and fix where I have gone wrong.

### Day 11: August 3, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:

### Day 12: August 4, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with job scheduler project. Looked at input functions and adding code to a txt file. Next I will look at connecting this through to a BST.


**Thoughts:** Slowly going through differenet elements of job scheduler project to ensure I understand the full process. Most makes sense at this stage.
