# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 24, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Working through Python for Everybody in FreeCodeCamp. Many focusing on While loops.

**Thoughts:** Struggle to understand fully how looping and iterations work. Once I get the hang of this it should make coding far easier.

### Day 2: July 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continue to Work through Python for Everybody in FreeCodeCamp. Today I watch a couple of video's on how to read files and loop through them. I also continued my course in Stackskill - Python Programming, CS, Algorithms and Data Structures. Currently doing linked lists, including stacked and queued. Mainly focused on revisting the code to set up a link list and how each one is written differently.

**Thoughts:** Slowly getting the hang of the connection. One thing I could not quite interpret is the self.tail.next = x component. Apart from that it all makes sense.
